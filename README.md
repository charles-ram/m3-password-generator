# Module 3 Password Generator

## Description

This project is a password generator that will produce a randomly generated password depending on the user inputs. The project consists of an index and css file for the front end of the project and javascript for the functions and code that help generate the password. The password generator is useful for highspeed generation of passwords that need to meet certain criteria. During this project I learned the importance of certain javascript functions that will need to be used again in future projects and why we use them.
